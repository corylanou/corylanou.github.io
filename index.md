Iâ€™m a full-stack technologist with 25 years of experience, specializing in start-ups. Over the years, I've founded several technology [companies](#companies-founded), including Pulsity, a web consulting firm from the late 90s. From Pulsity, I launched Local Launch, an internet marketing technology company that was acquired by RH Donnelly in 2006. I continued my journey in the technology sector, founding more companies, including Gopher Guides, a Go training company where I currently serve as a founding partner.

I co-authored an introductory book on Go titled "[Go Fundamentals](https://bit.ly/gofundamentals)," which is a comprehensive guide for both beginners and experienced developers. The book covers essential concepts and practical applications, making it an invaluable resource for mastering Go.

I have extensive experience in the Go ecosystem, having contributed to the Core engineering team at [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/), a highly scalable, distributed time series database written in Go. My work has focused on profiling and optimizing applications using advanced techniques like torch graphs and tracing profiles.

I am deeply involved in the Go community. I started one of the first Go meetups in the world, [Denver Gophers](https://www.meetup.com/denver-go-language-user-group/), and helped organize the first [GopherCon](https://www.gophercon.com/). I've led numerous Go workshops and training courses and published several online articles related to Go. Additionally, I help lead and organize various community technology meetups and mentor new developers.

When I'm not creating new Go training material, I volunteer my time helping local entrepreneurs start their own businesses. I offer free business advice and services, such as incorporating their business, setting up their web presence, and providing the moral support they need to turn their dreams into reality.
