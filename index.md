Cory has deep experience in the Go world, having worked on the Core engineering team that contributes to [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com), a highly scalable, distributed time series database written in Go. Cory has worked on several other Go projects with a focus on profiling and optimizing applications, using advanced profiling concepts such as torch graphs and tracing profiles.

Cory has deep ties to the Go community, having started one of the very first Go meetups in the world, [Denver Gophers](https://www.meetup.com/denver-go-language-user-group/), as well as assisting in the very first [GopherCon](https://www.gophercon.com/). Cory has created and led numerous Go workshops and training courses. He has several published online articles related to Go.

When Cory isn’t working on writing new Go training material, he volunteers his time helping local entrepreneurs start up their own businesses by offering free business advice and services, such as incorporating their business, getting their web presence set up, and giving them the morale support they need to make their dreams a reality.
